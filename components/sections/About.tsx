        My journey from a hands-on fullstack developer to an engineering manager has been driven by a passion for building not just
        great software, but great software teams. I thrive on the challenge of scaling B2B SaaS platforms, connecting technology with business
        outcomes, and fostering a culture of continuous learning. Balancing technical depth with a product-focused mindset is lead teams that deliver impactful solutions.
